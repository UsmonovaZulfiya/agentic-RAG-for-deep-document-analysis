# 🧠 Agentic RAG for Deep Document Analysis
*Reproducibility of “Building Three Pipelines to Select the Right LLMs for RAG, Multi-Agent Systems, and Vision”*

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository reproduces and extends the experiment described in [Fareed Khan’s LevelUp article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/building-three-pipelines-to-select-the-right-llms-for-rag-multi-agent-systems-and-vision-3e47e0563b76).  
The project implements an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that uses **hierarchical chunking**, **multi-step reasoning**, and **model routing** to enable deep question answering over complex documents.

The pipeline simulates how autonomous agents can navigate large legal or technical documents — selecting relevant text, refining search depth, and synthesizing structured answers with citations.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Hierarchical Chunking** – recursively splits documents into semantically meaningful segments using sentence-level boundaries.  
- **Agentic Navigation** – a router model iteratively selects the most relevant text chunks based on a question.  
- **Answer Synthesis** – a large instruction-tuned model summarizes retrieved evidence into a concise, citation-rich answer.  
- **Metrics Tracking** – logs latency, token counts, and step-level performance for each reasoning stage.  
- **Reproducible Environment** – compatible with [Nebius AI Studio](https://studio.nebius.ai) for hosted LLM inference.

## 🧩 Pipeline Architecture

1. **Document Loading** – Fetch a PDF (e.g., the *Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure*, TBMP) and extract its text.  
2. **Hierarchical Chunking** – Divide the text into multi-level chunks for scalable navigation.  
3. **Routing & Reasoning** – Use a smaller, efficient model (e.g., `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`) to reason about which chunks are most relevant.  
4. **Recursive Exploration** – Subdivide selected chunks and re-evaluate until the maximum depth is reached.  
5. **Answer Synthesis** – A high-capacity model (e.g., `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`) generates a structured answer with citations.  
6. **Evaluation (optional)** – A separate model (e.g., `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3`) can assess answer quality.

## 🧪 Reproducibility Steps

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/agentic-rag-reproduction.git
cd agentic-rag-reproduction
```

### 2) Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install openai pypdf nltk tqdm transformers pandas requests
```

### 3) Run the script

```bash
python agentic_rag_for_question_answering.py
```

Or open the notebook version in **Google Colab**.

### 4) Set up credentials

- Get your **Nebius AI API key** from <https://studio.nebius.ai>.  
- Log in to **Hugging Face** if using gated models:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

### 5) Observe the output

- The script prints chunking statistics, selected paragraphs, and a structured JSON answer with citations.  
- Metrics (latency, token counts, etc.) are stored in `metrics_log`.

## 📈 Example Output

```text
--- GENERATED ANSWER ---
"The TBMP requires that a motion to compel discovery include a signed certificate of service,
specify the discovery requests at issue, and comply with standard formatting (ID: 1.3.5, 1.3.9)."

--- CITATIONS ---
['1.3.5', '1.3.9']
```

## 📚 Research Context

This project illustrates how **agentic reasoning** and **RAG** pipelines can be combined to:

- Improve interpretability of multi-step LLM reasoning.  
- Emulate cognitive search behaviors in autonomous agents.  
- Enable scalable document analysis in domains like law, policy, or science.

It can serve as a foundation for future work on:

- Multi-agent retrieval coordination  
- RAG evaluation benchmarks  
- Adaptive routing and answer aggregation strategies
